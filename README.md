Sample code from EECE 2560. Fundamentals of Engineering Algorithms. Lab Partner Ray Trebicka

Project #1
In this project, you will write a complete program that allows the user to play a game of Mastermind
against the computer. 

Project #2
Write a program that allows the user to play the card game flip. Flip is played by one player with a
standard deck of 52 cards.

Project #3
Write a program that solves a word search puzzle.

Project #4/#5
Develop a data structure to store a known map of the robot's world for a given grid size. For example, you can assume that the physical environment for Cozmo will be 48x36in (size of a standard 3-fold poster board). You need to decide on a grid size that will make sense for Cozmo. You need to decide on a method to store the map. A text file will work. 
Develop the wavefront algorithm for Cozmo to plan and execute a path from a start to goal position. Obstacles will be other Cozmos so depending on your grid size they can occupy multiple cells. 

Prjoect #6
In this project, you will develop two capabilities for soccer playing Cozmo robots, penalty kicking and goal keeping. Penalty mark is located 18 in from the midpoint between the goalposts and equidistant to them. The goalposts will be marked by two Cozmo cubes that are 24 in apart. The penalty kick setup will be as follows
